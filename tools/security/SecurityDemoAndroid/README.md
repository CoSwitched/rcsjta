# Tag Auth Sample

This is a trivial Android app that loads the IARIValidator and processes an IARI Authorization document.

You will need to copy the following files to the root of /sdcard/ from the tag-auth-validator project:

    test/iari-authorization.xml
    test/keys/range-root-truststore.bks
